# Portfolio

## Description

Build a portfolio page, which I can add to as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. 

With these points in mind, I’ll set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I'll get to practice my new skills while creating something that I will use during my job search. It’s a win-win that I'll likely be grateful for in the future!
